    <h4>Resource 1: What is a smartphone sensor?</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Smartphones rely on numerous specialized sensors to allow you to fully utilize the apps, features, and services at your disposal. A sensor is a tiny device or module that measures various aspects of their surroundings including ambient light, device orientation, movement, and much more. Smartphone sensors are broadly classified into three types; motion sensors, position sensors, and environmental sensors. Sensors are the devices that make smartphones smarter and help processors enable various features.</p>

    <h4>Resource 2: How does GPS work on my phone?</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The GPS (Global Positioning System) sensor found in mobile devices works in the same way on every phone regardless of the operating system. It’s a technology developed and owned by the U.S. government but is free for everyone to use. GPS is a radio navigation system that uses radio waves between satellites and a receiver inside mobile phones to provide location and time information to any software that needs to use it. To utilize this system, you only need to receive data from at least 4 out of 28 satellites in orbit that are dedicated for geolocation use. The data from the satellites are then used to triangulate where you are and what time it is. However, GPS uses a lot of power and is slow so AGPS (Assisted Global Positioning System) adds cellular location data to assist geolocation. AGPS uses less power, is faster, and tracks your location through “pings” to cell towers with the caveat that it requires a cellular connection. This means that AGPS used alongside GPS will result in the best performance.

    <h4>Resource 3: How does auto brightness work on a phone or laptop?</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ambient light sensors are photodetectors used to sense the amount of ambient light present and appropriately dim the devices screen to match it. The three common types of ambient light sensors are; phototransistors, photodiodes, and photonic integrated circuits. As devices have continued to become more advanced, so has auto-brightness. Some devices utilize AI to adjust screen brightness while others use additional sensors to not only adjust the brightness, but also color temperature to match your surroundings.</p>

    <h4>Resource 4: Environment sensors</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The android platform provides four sensors that let you monitor ambient humidity, illuminance, ambient pressure, and ambient temperature. All four of these sensors are hardware-based meaning that they’re only available if the device manufacturer built them into a device. Because of this, it is important to verify the existence of environmental sensors before attempting to acquire data from it. On the other hand, environment sensors do not typically require data filtering or data processing. This makes them some of the easiest sensors to use as the raw data from these sensors can be used as is.</p>

    <h4>Resource 5: Build location-aware apps</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Adding location awareness to an app offers users a more contextual experience. To utilize this feature of location awareness this page has development resources on requesting proper permissions, receiving location updates, optimizing power usage, adding maps to your app, and location samples.</p>
